A client library for the [clubhouse.io](https://clubhouse.io/) [v2 REST](https://clubhouse.io/) and [Webhook](https://clubhouse.io/) APIs.

WIP

## Installation

Once [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_clubhouse` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

This isn't ready yet, so don't try.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_clubhouse, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ex_clubhouse](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_clubhouse).

## TODO
